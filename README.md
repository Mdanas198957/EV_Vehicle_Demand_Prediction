EV (Electric Vehicle) Charging Demand Prediction:
This component focuses on forecasting electric vehicle charging demand based on historical data and external factors and location.
Developed machine learning models to forecast EV adoption and estimate charging infrastructure demand using county-level data.
Worked on data preprocessing, feature engineering,Data Analysis using csv and pandas, Sustainable visualization with Python and Scikit-learn.
Requirements used:
numpy==1.26.4
pandas==1.5.3
scikit-learn==1.6.1
scipy==1.15.2
statsmodels==0.14.4
streamlit==1.44.1
tensorflow==2.19.0
Although it was new to work with ML models,This was Fun.
Deployed {app.py} frontend application using Streamlit.
